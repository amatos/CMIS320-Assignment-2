\section{Description}
This database system will help \emph{Acme Video Rental} modernize their business by digitizing a currently manual process, which will help \emph{Acme Video Rental} be more effective, efficient, and better serve their customers.  The database will collect information on Actors, Movies, Directors, Producers, movie genres, release years, and awards, mapping those entities with relationships such that \emph{Acme Video Rental} staff can help customers by directing them to what movies have won Academy Awards, which movies feature which actors and actresses, which films were produced by certain producers, or movies within certain genres that were released in a given year.

In order to help \emph{Acme Video Rental} better their costs, the database system will also take in electronic data provided by various suppliers, so that \emph{Acme Video Rental} staff can search their suppliers' catalogues to identify which supplier offers the best price for a specific movie and format (i.e., ``Gone with the Wind'' in VHS may be one price, but the DVD may be a different price.).  By querying the database for the price of a specific movie, \emph{Acme Video Rental} can determine which supplier offers the lowest cost.

The database system will also help \emph{Acme Video Rental} track their customers by recording when a Movie is rented, and whether any fees are due as a result of either damaged, late, or, in the case of VHS tapes, a failure to rewind the tape before it is returned.  This will also provide a benefit to \emph{Acme Video Rental}'s customers, who will be able to track what movies they have rented, and possibly identify previously unknown preferences on genres, directors, actors and actresses.  As an additional benefit, \emph{Acme Video Rental} will also be able to offer ``Family Accounts'' so that other members of a customer's family will be able to consolidate billing under a single individual.  This also provides a measure of parental controls, as ``Family Account'' members can be restricted to only rent movies under a predefined rating (That is, a restricted child account should not be able to rent an 'R' or 'MA' movie).
